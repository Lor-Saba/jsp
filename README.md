# JPS 
__________________________

#####Long story short: 
[JsPerf](https://jsperf.com/) is offline since ~2 or more months now so, the need to test codes led me to build a small jsperf-like application for myself to use until jsperf will comeback in [v2](https://github.com/jsperf/jsperf.com)

I didn't add a database to store the test-case created (since it was the jsperf's main problem), 
Instead I choose to save the current test-case in `localStorage` and the ability to **export** it.

#####What I used to realize it:
 - [benchmarkjs](https://benchmarkjs.com/): which sould be used by jsperf too
 - [Blob pages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob): used to create local pages for testing on runtime
